                <p>Whilst relatively slow to get there, the foodservice market has now fully embraced the digital world. The effects have seen a change in behaviour that needs to be understood in order to survive and thrive.</p>

                <h2>There are seven key changes in behaviour</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>The competitive set has widened. The 4 - 5 players that you used to compete with are now 1000 - 2000. Choice is all around. Availability is everywhere.</li>
                    <li>People are less tolerant, faster to complain and harder to satisfy. They value quality, ease of service and immediacy above all.</li>
                    <li>People are more informed and knowledgeable than ever before. Where once you might have been the expert in your field, information and opinions on which to base decisions are just a click or two away.</li>
                    <li>Promiscuity is through the roof! People will no longer accept overpricing or poor service and will switch to another product or service in a heartbeat. They want value for money, which is not just about cheap goods or services, it’s about quality worth paying for.</li>
                    <li>Social media and forums have seen peer to peer communication go through the roof. The power of advocacy has the potential to both build and to destroy brands in a very short space of time. Opinions are formed via 'friends' or 'followers', corroborated by 'likes' and testimonials.</li>
                    <li>People are increasingly cynical about branding and marketing and demand relevance. If your marketing communications aren’t targeted, personalised and relevant to the recipient you might as well not bother.</li>
                    <li>People are now multichannel users and entirely dictate when and where your messages should be seeded. The demand to be 'always on' across multiple integrated channels is overwhelming.</li>

                    <p>Whilst these seven changes in behaviour may initially appear daunting, you simply need to embrace a customer-centric approach to your service and marketing strategy. More than ever before, B2B marketers need to get close to their target, listen to their needs and engage them throughout the buying process – and afterwards. We're doing this with all of our foodservice brands and we’re seeing incredible ROI for our efforts.</p>

                    <p>B2B Marketing wrote a very interesting white paper on customer centricity titled: 'Are B2B marketers just paying lip service to customer centricity?’ <a href="http://b2bmarketing.net/resources/research-are-b2b-marketers-just-paying-lip-service-customer-centricity" target="_blank">Download it here</a></p>
